# MetricsMachine Word List Builder
Created with the Type@Cooper class, 2019

This script will produce a word list file for MetricsMachine using random words from a dictionary file that contain each combination of pair.

A benefit of using this tool is that the order doesn't have to be alphabetical (i.e. "AA", "AB", "AC", etc.), the alphabet can be reordered so that similar shapes show up in the list near each other (kern all of the flats first, then the flats with rounds, etc.)

Consider this to only be a starting point! Be sure to proof your figures, punctuation, symbols, etc. However, those might not need to be formatted into words, the "Pair List Builder" in MetricsMachine should do fine.

The "Built word lists" directory has three sample word lists that were built with this tool.
